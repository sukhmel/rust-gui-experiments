Trying out different GUI crates, just to get to know what is possible and how to do it.

As a sample task Sudoku game is implemented with different feature-gated UIs:
* [floem](https://github.com/lapce/floem)
* [iced](https://github.com/iced-rs/iced)
* [slint](https://github.com/slint-ui/slint)

I plan to also try doing it in wasm (like [here](https://www.fosskers.ca/en/demo/game-of-life),
[repo](https://github.com/fosskers/fosskers.ca/tree/master/rust/game-of-life)) and [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) (it
appeared too complicated for me to get on the first try)
